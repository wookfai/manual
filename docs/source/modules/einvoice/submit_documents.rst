Submit Documents to LHDN
==========

Submitting documents to the tax authority is a crucial task for individuals and businesses to ensure compliance with tax regulations. Proper submission helps avoid penalties, ensures accurate tax calculations, and maintains good standing with the tax authority. This guide will walk you through the process step-by-step.

Type of Documents
--------------------
Documents that need to be submitted to LHDN include the followings :

* **Invoice** -- Invoice is a commercial document issued by Supplier to itemise and record a transaction with Buyer.
* **Credit Note** -- Credit note is the document issued by Suppliers to correct errors, apply discounts, or account for returns in a previously issued e-Invoice with the purpose of reducing the value of the original e-Invoice. This is used in situations where the reduction of the original e-Invoice does not involve return of monies to the Buyer.
* **Debit Note** -- Debit note is the document issued to indicate additional charges on a previously issued e-Invoice.
* **Refund Note** -- Refund note is the document issued by a Supplier to confirm the refund of the Buyerâ€™s payment. This is used in situations where there is a return of monies to the Buyer.
* **Self-Billed Invoice** -- There are certain circumstances where another party (other than the Supplier) will be allowed to issue a self-billed e-Invoice. Self-Billed Invoice refers to the self-billed e-Invoice that will be issued by the Buyer for the transaction with the Supplier, based on the circumstances as specified in Section 8 of the e-Invoice Specific Guideline.
